## Why Use leetpush?

Ever solved a brilliant LeetCode problem, only to lose the code or forget your logic? leetpush solves this by providing LeetCode-to-GitHub integration.

* **Build a Portfolio:** Automatically create a GitHub repository that showcases your coding skills and dedication to potential employers.
* **Track Your Progress:** Keep a detailed commit history of every problem you solve, making it easy to review your improvement over time.
* **Never Lose Your Work:** Your solutions are safely backed up in your own GitHub repository, accessible from anywhere.
* **Focus on Solving:** Forget the hassle of copy-pasting. We handle the backup, so you can focus on the problem.

## Features

*  **Automatic Sync:** Pushes your solution to GitHub the moment you successfully submit it on LeetCode.
*  **Problem Metadata:** Automatically includes the problem title, description, difficulty, and other details in the commit.
*  **Language Detection:** Correctly identifies the programming language and creates files with the proper extension (e.g., `.py`, `.js`, `.java`).
*  **Private & Public Repos:** You have full control over whether your solutions repository is public or private.
*  **Easy Setup:** Get up and running in under two minutes.



## Getting Started: 2-Minute Setup

1.  **Install the Extension:**
    * Get `leetpush` from the [**Chrome Web Store**](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/leetpush/fppdnbfkhpmppifbmmchnhpnmmickbin).

2.  **Configure `leetpush`:**
    * Click on the `leetpush` icon in your browser toolbar.
    * Follow the on-screen instructions to link your GitHub account and select a repository. If you don't have one, `leetpush` can help you create it.

That's it! You're ready to go.

## How It Works

Once configured, `leetpush` works silently in the background.

1.  Navigate to any problem on LeetCode and write your solution.
2.  Click the "Submit" button on LeetCode.
3.  Once your solution is accepted, `leetpush` automatically commits and pushes the code and problem details to your designated GitHub repository.
